# Drug Trials Classification Model – TCS iON RIOI Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project builds a **machine learning classification model** to predict the **side effects** of a drug trial based on:
- Age
- Gender
- Race

The dataset is **synthetically generated** using Python's `Faker` library to simulate 400,000 patient records, as per the TCS iON RIOI project requirements.

## 🎯 Objectives
1. Generate a dataset of 400,000 patients containing:
   - Name
   - Age
   - Gender
   - Race
   - Side Effects
2. Clean and preprocess the dataset.
3. Train and test a classification model.
4. Evaluate model accuracy and effectiveness.
5. Visualize results using:
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Feature Importance Chart
6. Save & load the trained model for future use.
7. Allow interactive predictions from user input.
